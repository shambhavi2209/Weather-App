# Weather-Monitoring-Based-Home-Automation

Weather Monitoring is an IOT based project in which we will build use esp32  to display temperature, humidity, pressure, luminosity, and altitude values on a web browser further we will also send data to ThingSpeak. We will be using various sensor to capture the values about which we will discuss in the 2nd section of this report. This weather data can be monitored from anywhere in the world using the IP address of ESP32. 
This project does not only limit itself to monitor various values but also can control home appliances such as fan according to the temperature of the surrounding, for that we have connected a servo motor which would rotate only when the temperature rises to a certain level. This project is a mini prototype version of what an automated temperature monitor controlled surrounding would work like.

# Application
•	Agriculture: Farmers can use this system to monitor weather conditions for crop planning and irrigation scheduling.
•	Weather Forecasting: Meteorologists can use the data collected from the project for weather prediction and analysis.
•	Smart Home Automation: Weather data can be integrated with smart home automation systems to control heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems based on weather conditions.
•	Disaster Management: The system can provide real-time weather data for disaster management agencies to monitor weather conditions and take necessary precautions during natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, and storms.

# Conclusion
The Weather Monitoring Project IoT based project using DHT11 & Pressure Sensor is an innovative solution for monitoring and analysing weather parameters in real-time. It has various applications in agriculture, weather forecasting, smart home automation, and disaster management. The project demonstrates the capabilities of IoT and sensor technologies in collecting and analysing data for making informed decisions in various domains. Further improvements and enhancements can be made to the system to enhance its accuracy, reliability, and usability.
